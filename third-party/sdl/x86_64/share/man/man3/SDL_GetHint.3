.SH RETURN VALUE

only remains valid until the hint is changed; if another thread might do
so, the app should supply locks and/or make a copy of the string\[char46] Note that
using a hint callback instead is always thread-safe, as SDL holds a lock on
the thread subsystem during the callback\[char46]
