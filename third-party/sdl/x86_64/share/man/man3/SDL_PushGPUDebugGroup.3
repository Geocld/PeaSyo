.SH NAME
SDL_PushGPUDebugGroup \- Begins a debug group with an arbitary name\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_gpu\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "void SDL_PushGPUDebugGroup(
.BI "    SDL_GPUCommandBuffer *command_buffer,
.BI "    const char *name);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Used for denoting groups of calls when viewing the command buffer
callstream in a graphics debugging tool\[char46]

Each call to 
.BR SDL_PushGPUDebugGroup
 must have a
corresponding call to 
.BR SDL_PopGPUDebugGroup
\[char46]

On some backends (e\[char46]g\[char46] Metal), pushing a debug group during a
render/blit/compute pass will create a group that is scoped to the native
pass rather than the command buffer\[char46] For best results, if you push a debug
group during a pass, always pop it in the same pass\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I command_buffer
a command buffer\[char46]
.TP
.I name
a UTF-8 string constant that names the group\[char46]
.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
