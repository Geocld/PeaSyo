.SH NAME
SDL_rand \- Generate a pseudo-random number less than n for positive n
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_stdinc\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "Sint32 SDL_rand(Sint32 n);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The method used is faster and of better quality than
.BR rand() % n
\[char46] Odds are
roughly 99\[char46]9% even for n = 1 million\[char46] Evenness is better for smaller n, and
much worse as n gets bigger\[char46]

Example: to simulate a d6 use
.BR SDL_rand(6) + 1
The +1 converts 0\[char46]\[char46]5 to
1\[char46]\[char46]6

If you want to generate a pseudo-random number in the full range of Sint32,
you should use: (Sint32)
.BR SDL_rand_bits
()

If you want reproducible output, be sure to initialize with

.BR SDL_srand
() first\[char46]

There are no guarantees as to the quality of the random sequence produced,
and this should not be used for security (cryptography, passwords) or where
money is on the line (loot-boxes, casinos)\[char46] There are many random number
libraries available with different characteristics and you should pick one
of those to meet any serious needs\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I n
the number of possible outcomes\[char46] n must be positive\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns a random value in the range of [0 \[char46]\[char46] n-1]\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
All calls should be made from a single thread

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
