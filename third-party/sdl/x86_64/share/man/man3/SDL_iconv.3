.TH SDL_iconv 3 "SDL 3.1.3" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_iconv \- This function converts text between encodings, reading from and writing to a buffer\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_stdinc\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "size_t SDL_iconv(SDL_iconv_t cd, const char **inbuf,
.BI "             size_t *inbytesleft, char **outbuf,
.BI "             size_t *outbytesleft);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
It returns the number of succesful conversions\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I cd
The character set conversion context, created in 
.BR SDL_iconv_open
()\[char46]
.TP
.I inbuf
Address of variable that points to the first character of the input sequence\[char46]
.TP
.I inbytesleft
The number of bytes in the input buffer\[char46]
.TP
.I outbuf
Address of variable that points to the output buffer\[char46]
.TP
.I outbytesleft
The number of bytes in the output buffer\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the number of conversions on success, else

.BR SDL_ICONV_E2BIG
 is returned when the output buffer is
too small, or 
.BR SDL_ICONV_EILSEQ
 is returned when an
invalid input sequence is encountered, or

.BR SDL_ICONV_EINVAL
 is returned when an incomplete input
sequence is encountered\[char46]

On exit:


\(bu inbuf will point to the beginning of the next multibyte sequence\[char46] On
error, this is the location of the problematic input sequence\[char46] On success,
this is the end of the input sequence\[char46] - inbytesleft will be set to the
number of bytes left to convert, which will be 0 on success\[char46] - outbuf will
point to the location where to store the next output byte\[char46] - outbytesleft
will be set to the number of bytes left in the output buffer\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
