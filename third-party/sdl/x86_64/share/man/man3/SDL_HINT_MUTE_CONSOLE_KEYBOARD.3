.SH DESCRIPTION
Normally the keyboard is muted while SDL applications are running so that
keyboard input doesn't show up as key strokes on the console\[char46] This hint
allows you to turn that off for debugging purposes\[char46]

The variable can be set to the following values:


\(bu "0": Allow keystrokes to go through to the console\[char46]

\(bu "1": Mute keyboard input so it doesn't show up on the console\[char46] (default)

This hint should be set before SDL is initialized\[char46]
