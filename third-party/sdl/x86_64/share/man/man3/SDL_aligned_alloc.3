SDL_aligned_alloc \- Allocate memory aligned to a specific alignment\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_stdinc\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "void * SDL_aligned_alloc(size_t alignment, size_t size);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The memory returned by this function must be freed with

.BR SDL_aligned_free
(), _not_ 
.BR SDL_free
()\[char46]

If
.BR alignment
is less than the size of
.BR void *
, it will be increased to
match that\[char46]

The returned memory address will be a multiple of the alignment value, and
the size of the memory allocated will be a multiple of the alignment value\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I alignment
the alignment of the memory\[char46]
.TP
.I size
the size to allocate\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns a pointer to the aligned memory, or NULL if allocation
failed\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]
