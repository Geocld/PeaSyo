.SH NAME
SDL_WaitConditionTimeout \- Wait until a condition variable is signaled or a certain time has passed\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_mutex\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool SDL_WaitConditionTimeout(SDL_Condition *cond,
.BI "                    SDL_Mutex *mutex, Sint32 timeoutMS);

.SH DESCRIPTION
This function unlocks the specified
.BR mutex
and waits for another thread to
call 
.BR SDL_SignalCondition
() or

.BR SDL_BroadcastCondition
() on the condition
variable
.BR cond
, or for the specified time to elapse\[char46] Once the condition
variable is signaled or the time elapsed, the mutex is re-locked and the
function returns\[char46]

The mutex must be locked before calling this function\[char46] Locking the mutex
recursively (more than once) is not supported and leads to undefined
behavior\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I cond
the condition variable to wait on\[char46]
.TP
.I mutex
the mutex used to coordinate thread access\[char46]
.TP
.I timeoutMS
the maximum time to wait, in milliseconds, or -1 to wait indefinitely\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true if the condition variable is signaled, false if the
condition is not signaled in the allotted time\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
