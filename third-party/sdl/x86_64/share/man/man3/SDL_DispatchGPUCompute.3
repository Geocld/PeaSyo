.SH NAME
SDL_DispatchGPUCompute \- Dispatches compute work\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_gpu\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "void SDL_DispatchGPUCompute(
.BI "    SDL_GPUComputePass *compute_pass,

.SH DESCRIPTION
You must not call this function before binding a compute pipeline\[char46]

A VERY IMPORTANT NOTE If you dispatch multiple times in a compute pass, and
the dispatches write to the same resource region as each other, there is no
guarantee of which order the writes will occur\[char46] If the write order matters,
you MUST end the compute pass and begin another one\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I compute_pass
a compute pass handle\[char46]
.TP
.I groupcount_x
number of local workgroups to dispatch in the X dimension\[char46]
.TP
.I groupcount_y
number of local workgroups to dispatch in the Y dimension\[char46]
.TP
.I groupcount_z
number of local workgroups to dispatch in the Z dimension\[char46]
.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
