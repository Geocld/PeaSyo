.SH NAME
SDL_GPUCommandBuffer \- An opaque handle representing a command buffer\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_gpu\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS

.PP
.BI "typedef struct SDL_GPUCommandBuffer SDL_GPUCommandBuffer;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Most state is managed via command buffers\[char46] When setting state using a
command buffer, that state is local to the command buffer\[char46]

Commands only begin execution on the GPU once

.BR SDL_SubmitGPUCommandBuffer
 is called\[char46] Once
the command buffer is submitted, it is no longer valid to use it\[char46]

Command buffers are executed in submission order\[char46] If you submit command
buffer A and then command buffer B all commands in A will begin executing
before any command in B begins executing\[char46]

In multi-threading scenarios, you should acquire and submit a command
buffer on the same thread\[char46] As long as you satisfy this requirement, all
functionality related to command buffers is thread-safe\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This struct is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0
