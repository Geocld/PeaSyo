.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int * SDL_GetAudioDeviceChannelMap(SDL_AudioDeviceID devid, int *count);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Channel maps are optional; most things do not need them, instead passing
data in the [order that SDL expects](CategoryAudio#channel-layouts)\[char46]

Audio devices usually have no remapping applied\[char46] This is represented by
returning NULL, and does not signify an error\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I devid
the instance ID of the device to query\[char46]
.TP
.I count
On output, set to number of channels in the map\[char46] Can be NULL\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns an array of the current channel mapping, with as many
elements as the current output spec's channels, or NULL if default\[char46] This
should be freed with 
.BR SDL_free
() when it is no longer needed\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
