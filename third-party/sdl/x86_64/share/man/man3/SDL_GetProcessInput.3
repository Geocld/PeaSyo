.SH NAME
SDL_GetProcessInput \- Get the 
.BR SDL_IOStream
 associated with process standard input\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_process\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "SDL_IOStream* SDL_GetProcessInput(SDL_Process *process);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The process must have been created with

.BR SDL_CreateProcess
() and pipe_stdio set to true, or
with 
.BR SDL_CreateProcessWithProperties
()
and

.BR
.BR SDL_PROP_PROCESS_CREATE_STDIN_NUMBER
set to 
.BR
.BR SDL_PROCESS_STDIO_APP
\[char46]

Writing to this stream can return less data than expected if the process
hasn't read its input\[char46] It may be blocked waiting for its output to be read,
so if you may need to call 
.BR SDL_GetOutputStream
() and
read the output in parallel with writing input\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I process
The process to get the input stream for\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
(
.BR SDL_IOStream
 *) Returns the input stream or NULL on
failure; call 
.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY

.SH AVAILABILITY
