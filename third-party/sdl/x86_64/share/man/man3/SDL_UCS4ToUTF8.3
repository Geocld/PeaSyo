.SH NAME
SDL_UCS4ToUTF8 \- Convert a single Unicode codepoint to UTF-8\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_stdinc\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "char * SDL_UCS4ToUTF8(Uint32 codepoint, char *dst);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The buffer pointed to by
.BR dst
must be at least 4 bytes long, as this
function may generate between 1 and 4 bytes of output\[char46]

This function returns the first byte _after_ the newly-written UTF-8
sequence, which is useful for encoding multiple codepoints in a loop, or
knowing where to write a NULL-terminator character to end the string (in
either case, plan to have a buffer of _more_ than 4 bytes!)\[char46]

If
.BR codepoint
is an invalid value (outside the Unicode range, or a UTF-16
surrogate value, etc), this will use U+FFFD (REPLACEMENT CHARACTER) for the
codepoint instead, and not set an error\[char46]

If
.BR dst
is NULL, this returns NULL immediately without writing to the
pointer and without setting an error\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I codepoint
a Unicode codepoint to convert to UTF-8\[char46]
.TP
.I dst
the location to write the encoded UTF-8\[char46] Must point to at least 4 bytes!
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the first byte past the newly-written UTF-8 sequence\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
