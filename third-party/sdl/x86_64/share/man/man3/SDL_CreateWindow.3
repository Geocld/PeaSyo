.SH DESCRIPTION

.BR flags
may be any of the following OR'd together:


\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN
: fullscreen window at
  desktop resolution

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL
: window usable with an OpenGL
  context

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOW_OCCLUDED
: window partially or
  completely obscured by another window

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOW_HIDDEN
: window is not visible

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOW_BORDERLESS
: no window decoration

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE
: window can be resized

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOW_MINIMIZED
: window is minimized

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOW_MAXIMIZED
: window is maximized

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOW_MOUSE_GRABBED
: window has
  grabbed mouse focus

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOW_INPUT_FOCUS
: window has input
  focus

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOW_MOUSE_FOCUS
: window has mouse
  focus

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOW_EXTERNAL
: window not created by SDL

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOW_MODAL
: window is modal

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOW_HIGH_PIXEL_DENSITY
: window
  uses high pixel density back buffer if possible

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOW_MOUSE_CAPTURE
: window has mouse
  captured (unrelated to MOUSE_GRABBED)

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOW_ALWAYS_ON_TOP
: window should
  always be above others

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOW_UTILITY
: window should be treated as a
  utility window, not showing in the task bar and window list

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOW_TOOLTIP
: window should be treated as a
  tooltip and does not get mouse or keyboard focus, requires a parent
  window

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOW_POPUP_MENU
: window should be
  treated as a popup menu, requires a parent window

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOW_KEYBOARD_GRABBED
: window has
  grabbed keyboard input

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOW_VULKAN
: window usable with a Vulkan
  instance

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOW_METAL
: window usable with a Metal
  instance

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOW_TRANSPARENT
: window with
  transparent buffer

\(bu 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOW_NOT_FOCUSABLE
: window should not
  be focusable

The 
.BR SDL_Window
 is implicitly shown if

.BR SDL_WINDOW_HIDDEN
 is not set\[char46]

On Apple's macOS, you
.B must
set the NSHighResolutionCapable Info\[char46]plist
property to YES, otherwise you will not receive a High-DPI OpenGL canvas\[char46]

The window pixel size may differ from its window coordinate size if the
window is on a high pixel density display\[char46] Use

.BR SDL_GetWindowSize
() to query the client area's size in
window coordinates, and

.BR SDL_GetWindowSizeInPixels
() or

.BR SDL_GetRenderOutputSize
() to query the drawable
size in pixels\[char46] Note that the drawable size can vary after the window is
created and should be queried again if you get an

.BR SDL_EVENT_WINDOW_PIXEL_SIZE_CHANGED

event\[char46]

If the window is created with any of the

.BR SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL
 or

.BR SDL_WINDOW_VULKAN
 flags, then the corresponding
LoadLibrary function (
.BR SDL_GL_LoadLibrary
 or

.BR SDL_Vulkan_LoadLibrary
) is called and the
corresponding UnloadLibrary function is called by

.BR SDL_DestroyWindow
()\[char46]

If 
.BR SDL_WINDOW_VULKAN
 is specified and there isn't a
working Vulkan driver, 
.BR SDL_CreateWindow
() will fail
because 
.BR SDL_Vulkan_LoadLibrary
() will fail\[char46]

If 
.BR SDL_WINDOW_METAL
 is specified on an OS that does not
support Metal, 
.BR SDL_CreateWindow
() will fail\[char46]

If you intend to use this window with an 
.BR SDL_Renderer
, you
should use 
.BR SDL_CreateWindowAndRenderer
()
instead of this function, to avoid window flicker\[char46]

On non-Apple devices, SDL requires you to either not link to the Vulkan
loader or link to a dynamic library version\[char46] This limitation may be removed
in a future version of SDL\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I title
the title of the window, in UTF-8 encoding\[char46]
.TP
.I w
the width of the window\[char46]
.TP
.I h
the height of the window\[char46]
.TP
.I flags
0, or one or more 
.BR SDL_WindowFlags
 OR'd together\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
(
.BR SDL_Window
 *) Returns the window that was created or NULL on
failure; call 
.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
