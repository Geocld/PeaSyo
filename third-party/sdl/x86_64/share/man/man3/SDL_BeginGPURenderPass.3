.SH DESCRIPTION
A render pass consists of a set of texture subresources (or depth slices in
the 3D texture case) which will be rendered to during the render pass,
along with corresponding clear values and load/store operations\[char46] All
operations related to graphics pipelines must take place inside of a render
pass\[char46] A default viewport and scissor state are automatically set when this
is called\[char46] You cannot begin another render pass, or begin a compute pass or
copy pass until you have ended the render pass\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I command_buffer
a command buffer\[char46]
.TP
.I color_target_infos
an array of texture subresources with corresponding clear values and load/store ops\[char46]
.TP
.I num_color_targets
the number of color targets in the color_target_infos array\[char46]
.TP
.I depth_stencil_target_info
a texture subresource with corresponding clear value and load/store ops, may be NULL\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
(
.BR SDL_GPURenderPass
 *) Returns a render pass handle\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
