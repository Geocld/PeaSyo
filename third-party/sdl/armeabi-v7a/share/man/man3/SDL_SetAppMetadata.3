.TH SDL_SetAppMetadata 3 "SDL 3.1.3" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_SetAppMetadata \- Specify basic metadata about your app\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_init\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool SDL_SetAppMetadata(const char *appname, const char *appversion, const char *appidentifier);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
You can optionally provide metadata about your app to SDL\[char46] This is not
required, but strongly encouraged\[char46]

There are several locations where SDL can make use of metadata (an "About"
box in the macOS menu bar, the name of the app can be shown on some audio
mixers, etc)\[char46] Any piece of metadata can be left as NULL, if a specific
detail doesn't make sense for the app\[char46]

This function should be called as early as possible, before

.BR SDL_Init
\[char46] Multiple calls to this function are allowed, but
various state might not change once it has been set up with a previous call
to this function\[char46]

Passing a NULL removes any previous metadata\[char46]

This is a simplified interface for the most important information\[char46] You can
supply significantly more detailed metadata with

.BR SDL_SetAppMetadataProperty
()\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I appname
The name of the application ("My Game 2: Bad Guy's Revenge!")\[char46]
.TP
.I appversion
The version of the application ("1\[char46]0\[char46]0beta5" or a git hash, or whatever makes sense)\[char46]
.TP
.I appidentifier
A unique string in reverse-domain format that identifies this app ("com\[char46]example\[char46]mygame2")\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true on success or false on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
