.SH NAME
SDL_CloseIO \- Close and free an allocated 
.BR SDL_IOStream
 structure\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_iostream\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool SDL_CloseIO(SDL_IOStream *context);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION

.BR SDL_CloseIO
() closes and cleans up the

.BR SDL_IOStream
 stream\[char46] It releases any resources used by the
stream and frees the 
.BR SDL_IOStream
 itself\[char46] This returns true
on success, or false if the stream failed to flush to its output (e\[char46]g\[char46] to
disk)\[char46]

Note that if this fails to flush the stream for any reason, this function
reports an error, but the 
.BR SDL_IOStream
 is still invalid
once this function returns\[char46]

This call flushes any buffered writes to the operating system, but there
are no guarantees that those writes have gone to physical media; they might
be in the OS's file cache, waiting to go to disk later\[char46] If it's absolutely
crucial that writes go to disk immediately, so they are definitely stored
even if the power fails before the file cache would have caught up, one
should call 
.BR SDL_FlushIO
() before closing\[char46] Note that flushing
takes time and makes the system and your app operate less efficiently, so
do so sparingly\[char46]
