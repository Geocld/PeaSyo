.SH DESCRIPTION
When you call 
.BR SDL_BindGPUVertexBuffers
, you
specify the binding slots of the vertex buffers\[char46] For example if you called

.BR SDL_BindGPUVertexBuffers
 with a first_slot of 2
and num_bindings of 3, the binding slots 2, 3, 4 would be used by the
vertex buffers you pass in\[char46]

Vertex attributes are linked to buffers via the buffer_slot field of

.BR SDL_GPUVertexAttribute
\[char46] For example, if an
attribute has a buffer_slot of 0, then that attribute belongs to the vertex
buffer bound at slot 0\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This struct is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0
