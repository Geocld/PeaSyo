.SH NAME
SDL_HINT_ASSERT \- A variable controlling response to 
.BR SDL_assert
 failures\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_hints\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "#define SDL_HINT_ASSERT "SDL_ASSERT"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The variable can be set to the following case-sensitive values:


\(bu "abort": Program terminates immediately\[char46]

\(bu "break": Program triggers a debugger breakpoint\[char46]

\(bu "retry": Program reruns the 
.BR SDL_assert
's test again\[char46]

\(bu "ignore": Program continues on, ignoring this assertion failure this
  time\[char46]

\(bu "always_ignore": Program continues on, ignoring this assertion failure
  for the rest of the run\[char46]

Note that 
.BR SDL_SetAssertionHandler
 offers a
programmatic means to deal with assertion failures through a callback, and
this hint is largely intended to be used via environment variables by end
users and automated tools\[char46]

This hint should be set before an assertion failure is triggered and can be
changed at any time\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
