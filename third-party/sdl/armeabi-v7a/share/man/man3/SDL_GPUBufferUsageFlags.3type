.SH DESCRIPTION
A buffer must have at least one usage flag\[char46] Note that some usage flag
combinations are invalid\[char46]

Unlike textures, READ | WRITE can be used for simultaneous read-write
usage\[char46] The same data synchronization concerns as textures apply\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This datatype is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0
