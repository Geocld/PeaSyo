.SH NAME
SDL_AcquireGPUSwapchainTexture \- Acquire a texture to use in presentation\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_gpu\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool SDL_AcquireGPUSwapchainTexture(
.BI "    SDL_GPUCommandBuffer *command_buffer,
.BI "    SDL_Window *window,
.BI "    SDL_GPUTexture **swapchain_texture,
.BI "    Uint32 *swapchain_texture_width,
.BI "    Uint32 *swapchain_texture_height);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
When a swapchain texture is acquired on a command buffer, it will
automatically be submitted for presentation when the command buffer is
submitted\[char46] The swapchain texture should only be referenced by the command
buffer used to acquire it\[char46] The swapchain texture handle can be filled in
with NULL under certain conditions\[char46] This is not necessarily an error\[char46] If
this function returns false then there is an error\[char46]

The swapchain texture is managed by the implementation and must not be
freed by the user\[char46] You MUST NOT call this function from any thread other
than the one that created the window\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I command_buffer
a command buffer\[char46]
.TP
.I window
a window that has been claimed\[char46]
.TP
.I swapchain_texture
a pointer filled in with a swapchain texture handle\[char46]
.TP
.I swapchain_texture_width
a pointer filled in with the swapchain texture width, may be NULL\[char46]
.TP
.I swapchain_texture_height
a pointer filled in with the swapchain texture height, may be NULL\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true on success, false on error; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
