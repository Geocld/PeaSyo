.SH DESCRIPTION
These are the valid values for the
.BR axis
field in

.BR SDL_PenAxisEvent
\[char46] All axes are either normalised to
0\[char46]\[char46]1 or report a (positive or negative) angle in degrees, with 0\[char46]0
representing the centre\[char46] Not all pens/backends support all axes:
unsupported axes are always zero\[char46]

To convert angles for tilt and rotation into vector representation, use

.BR SDL_sinf
 on the XTILT, YTILT, or ROTATION component, for
example:
.BR SDL_sinf(xtilt * SDL_PI_F / 180\[char46]0)
\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This enum is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0
