.SH DESCRIPTION
When a pen becomes visible to the system (it is close enough to a tablet,
etc), SDL will send an

.BR SDL_EVENT_PEN_PROXIMITY_IN
 event with the new
pen's ID\[char46] This ID is valid until the pen leaves proximity again (has been
removed from the tablet's area, the tablet has been unplugged, etc)\[char46] If the
same pen reenters proximity again, it will be given a new ID\[char46]

Note that "proximity" means "close enough for the tablet to know the tool
is there\[char46]" The pen touching and lifting off from the tablet while not
leaving the area are handled by 
.BR SDL_EVENT_PEN_DOWN

and 
.BR SDL_EVENT_PEN_UP
\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This struct is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
