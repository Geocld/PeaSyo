.SH NAME
SDL_AtomicInt \- A type representing an atomic integer value\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_atomic\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "typedef struct SDL_AtomicInt { int value; } SDL_AtomicInt;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This can be used to manage a value that is synchronized across multiple
CPUs without a race condition; when an app sets a value with

.BR SDL_SetAtomicInt
 all other threads, regardless of the
CPU it is running on, will see that value when retrieved with

.BR SDL_GetAtomicInt
, regardless of CPU caches, etc\[char46]

This is also useful for atomic compare-and-swap operations: a thread can
change the value as long as its current value matches expectations\[char46] When
done in a loop, one can guarantee data consistency across threads without a
lock (but the usual warnings apply: if you don't know what you're doing, or
you don't do it carefully, you can confidently cause any number of
disasters with this, so in most cases, you _should_ use a mutex instead of
this!)\[char46]

This is a struct so people don't accidentally use numeric operations on it
directly\[char46] You have to use SDL atomic functions\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This struct is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
