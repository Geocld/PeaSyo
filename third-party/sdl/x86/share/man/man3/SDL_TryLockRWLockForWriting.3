.TH SDL_TryLockRWLockForWriting 3 "SDL 3.1.3" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_TryLockRWLockForWriting \- Try to lock a read/write lock _for writing_ without blocking\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_mutex\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool SDL_TryLockRWLockForWriting(SDL_RWLock *rwlock);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This works just like

.BR SDL_LockRWLockForWriting
(), but if the rwlock
is not available, then this function returns false immediately\[char46]

This technique is useful if you need exclusive access to a resource but
don't want to wait for it, and will return to it to try again later\[char46]

It is illegal for the owning thread to lock an already-locked rwlock for
writing (read-only may be locked recursively, writing can not)\[char46] Doing so
results in undefined behavior\[char46]

It is illegal to request a write lock from a thread that already holds a
read-only lock\[char46] Doing so results in undefined behavior\[char46] Unlock the
read-only lock before requesting a write lock\[char46]

This function returns true if passed a NULL rwlock\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I rwlock
the rwlock to try to lock\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true on success, false if the lock would block\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
