.SH NAME
SDL_SetTLS \- Set the current thread's value associated with a thread local storage ID\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_thread\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool SDL_SetTLS(SDL_TLSID *id, const void *value, SDL_TLSDestructorCallback destructor);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
If the thread local storage ID is not initialized (the value is 0), a new
ID will be created in a thread-safe way, so all calls using a pointer to
the same ID will refer to the same local storage\[char46]

Note that replacing a value from a previous call to this function on the
same thread does _not_ call the previous value's destructor!
.BR destructor
can be NULL; it is assumed that
.BR value
does not need to be
cleaned up if so\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I id
a pointer to the thread local storage ID, may not be NULL\[char46]
.TP
.I value
the value to associate with the ID for the current thread\[char46]
.TP
.I destructor
a function called when the thread exits, to free the value, may be NULL\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true on success or false on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
