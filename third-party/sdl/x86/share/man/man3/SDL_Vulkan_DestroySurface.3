.SH NAME
SDL_Vulkan_DestroySurface \- Destroy the Vulkan rendering surface of a window\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_vulkan\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "void SDL_Vulkan_DestroySurface(VkInstance instance,
.BI "                           VkSurfaceKHR surface,
.BI "                           const struct VkAllocationCallbacks *allocator);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This should be called before 
.BR SDL_DestroyWindow
, if

.BR SDL_Vulkan_CreateSurface
 was called after

.BR SDL_CreateWindow
\[char46]

The
.BR instance
must have been created with extensions returned by

.BR SDL_Vulkan_GetInstanceExtensions
()
enabled and
.BR surface
must have been created successfully by an

.BR SDL_Vulkan_CreateSurface
() call\[char46]

If
.BR allocator
is NULL, Vulkan will use the system default allocator\[char46] This
argument is passed directly to Vulkan and isn't used by SDL itself\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I instance
the Vulkan instance handle\[char46]
.TP
.I surface
vkSurfaceKHR handle to destroy\[char46]
.TP
.I allocator
a VkAllocationCallbacks struct, which lets the app set the allocator that destroys the surface\[char46] Can be NULL\[char46]
.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
