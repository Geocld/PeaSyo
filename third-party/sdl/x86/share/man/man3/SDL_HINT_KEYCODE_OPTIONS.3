.SH NAME
SDL_HINT_KEYCODE_OPTIONS \- A variable that controls keycode representation in keyboard events\[char46]

Defined in SDL3/SDL_hints\[char46]h

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This variable is a comma separated set of options for translating keycodes
in events:


\(bu "none": Keycode options are cleared, this overrides other options\[char46]

\(bu "hide_numpad": The numpad keysyms will be translated into their
  non-numpad versions based on the current NumLock state\[char46] For example,
  
.BR SDLK_KP_4
 would become 
.BR SDLK_4
 if
  
.BR SDL_KMOD_NUM
 is set in the event modifiers, and
  
.BR SDLK_LEFT
 if it is unset\[char46]

\(bu "french_numbers": The number row on French keyboards is inverted, so
  pressing the 1 key would yield the keycode 
.BR SDLK_1
, or '1',
  instead of 
.BR SDLK_AMPERSAND
, or '&'

\(bu "latin_letters": For keyboards using non-Latin letters, such as Russian
  or Thai, the letter keys generate keycodes as though it had an en_US
  layout\[char46] e\[char46]g\[char46] pressing the key associated with
  
.BR SDL_SCANCODE_A
 on a Russian keyboard would yield 'a'
  instead of a Cyrillic letter\[char46]

The default value for this hint is "french_numbers,latin_letters"

Some platforms like Emscripten only provide modified keycodes and the
options are not used\[char46]

These options do not affect the return value of

.BR SDL_GetKeyFromScancode
() or

.BR SDL_GetScancodeFromKey
(), they just apply to the
keycode included in key events\[char46]

This hint can be set anytime\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
