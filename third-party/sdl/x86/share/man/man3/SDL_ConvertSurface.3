.TH SDL_ConvertSurface 3 "SDL 3.1.3" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_ConvertSurface \- Copy an existing surface to a new surface of the specified format\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_surface\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "SDL_Surface * SDL_ConvertSurface(SDL_Surface *surface, SDL_PixelFormat format);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function is used to optimize images for faster
.I repeat
blitting\[char46] This
is accomplished by converting the original and storing the result as a new
surface\[char46] The new, optimized surface can then be used as the source for
future blits, making them faster\[char46]

If you are converting to an indexed surface and want to map colors to a
palette, you can use

.BR SDL_ConvertSurfaceAndColorspace
()
instead\[char46]

If the original surface has alternate images, the new surface will have a
reference to them as well\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I surface
the existing 
.BR SDL_Surface
 structure to convert\[char46]
.TP
.I format
the new pixel format\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
(
.BR SDL_Surface
 *) Returns the new 
.BR SDL_Surface

structure that is created or NULL on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
