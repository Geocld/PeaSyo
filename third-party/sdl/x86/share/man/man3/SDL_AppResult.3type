.BI "typedef enum SDL_AppResult
.BI "{
.BI "    SDL_APP_CONTINUE,   /**< Value that requests that the app continue from the main callbacks. */

.SH DESCRIPTION
Returning 
.BR SDL_APP_SUCCESS
 or

.BR SDL_APP_FAILURE
 from 
.BR SDL_AppInit
,

.BR SDL_AppEvent
, or 
.BR SDL_AppIterate
 will
terminate the program and report success/failure to the operating system\[char46]
What that means is platform-dependent\[char46] On Unix, for example, on success,
the process error code will be zero, and on failure it will be 1\[char46] This
interface doesn't allow you to return specific exit codes, just whether
there was an error generally or not\[char46]

Returning 
.BR SDL_APP_CONTINUE
 from these functions will
let the app continue to run\[char46]

See

.URL "https://wiki\[char46]libsdl\[char46]org/SDL3/README/main-functions#main-callbacks-in-sdl3" "Main callbacks in SDL3"

for complete details\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This enum is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
