.SH NAME
SDL_HINT_MOUSE_RELATIVE_CLIP_INTERVAL \- Controls how often SDL issues cursor confinement commands to the operating system while relative mode is active, in case the desired confinement state became out-of-sync due to interference from other running programs\[char46]

Defined in SDL3/SDL_hints\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
The variable can be integers representing milliseconds between each
refresh\[char46] A value of zero means SDL will not automatically refresh the
confinement\[char46] The default value varies depending on the operating system,
this variable might not have any effects on inapplicable platforms such as
those without a cursor\[char46]

This hint can be set anytime\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
