.SH NAME
SDL_RenderPresent \- Update the screen with any rendering performed since the previous call\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_render\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool SDL_RenderPresent(SDL_Renderer *renderer);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
SDL's rendering functions operate on a backbuffer; that is, calling a
rendering function such as 
.BR SDL_RenderLine
() does not
directly put a line on the screen, but rather updates the backbuffer\[char46] As
such, you compose your entire scene and
.I present
the composed backbuffer
to the screen as a complete picture\[char46]

Therefore, when using SDL's rendering API, one does all drawing intended
for the frame, and then calls this function once per frame to present the
final drawing to the user\[char46]

The backbuffer should be considered invalidated after each present; do not
assume that previous contents will exist between frames\[char46] You are strongly
encouraged to call 
.BR SDL_RenderClear
() to initialize the
backbuffer before starting each new frame's drawing, even if you plan to
overwrite every pixel\[char46]

Please note, that in case of rendering to a texture - there is
.B no need
to call 
.BR
.BR SDL_RenderPresent
after drawing needed
objects to a texture, and should not be done; you are only required to
change back the rendering target to default via
.BR SDL_SetRenderTarget(renderer, NULL)
afterwards, as textures by themselves
do not have a concept of backbuffers\[char46] Calling

.BR SDL_RenderPresent
 while rendering to a texture will
still update the screen with any current drawing that has been done _to the
window itself_\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I renderer
the rendering context\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true on success or false on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
You may only call this function from the main thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
