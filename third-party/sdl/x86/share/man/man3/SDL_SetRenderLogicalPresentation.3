.TH SDL_SetRenderLogicalPresentation 3 "SDL 3.1.3" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_SetRenderLogicalPresentation \- Set a device independent resolution and presentation mode for rendering\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_render\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool SDL_SetRenderLogicalPresentation(SDL_Renderer *renderer, int w, int h, SDL_RendererLogicalPresentation mode);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function sets the width and height of the logical rendering output\[char46]
The renderer will act as if the window is always the requested dimensions,
scaling to the actual window resolution as necessary\[char46]

This can be useful for games that expect a fixed size, but would like to
scale the output to whatever is available, regardless of how a user resizes
a window, or if the display is high DPI\[char46]

You can disable logical coordinates by setting the mode to

.BR SDL_LOGICAL_PRESENTATION_DISABLED
, and
in that case you get the full pixel resolution of the output window; it is
safe to toggle logical presentation during the rendering of a frame:
perhaps most of the rendering is done to specific dimensions but to make
fonts look sharp, the app turns off logical presentation while drawing
text\[char46]

Letterboxing will only happen if logical presentation is enabled during

.BR SDL_RenderPresent
; be sure to reenable it first if you
were using it\[char46]

You can convert coordinates in an event into rendering coordinates using

.BR SDL_ConvertEventToRenderCoordinates
()\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I renderer
the rendering context\[char46]
.TP
.I w

.TP
.I h
the height of the logical resolution\[char46]
.TP
.I mode

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true on success or false on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
You may only call this function from the main thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
