.SH NAME
SDL_FunctionPointer \- A generic function pointer\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_stdinc\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "typedef void (*SDL_FunctionPointer)(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
In theory, generic function pointers should use this, instead of
.BR void
.I 
,
since some platforms could treat code addresses differently than data
addresses\[char46] Although in current times no popular platforms make this
distinction, it is more correct and portable to use the correct type for a
generic pointer\[char46]

If for some reason you need to force this typedef to be an actual
.BR void 
,
perhaps to work around a compiler or existing code, you can define

.BR
.BR SDL_FUNCTION_POINTER_IS_VOID_POINTER
before including any SDL headers\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This datatype is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
