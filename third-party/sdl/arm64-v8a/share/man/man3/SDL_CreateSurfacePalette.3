.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function creates a palette compatible with the provided surface\[char46] The
palette is then returned for you to modify, and the surface will
automatically use the new palette in future operations\[char46] You do not need to
destroy the returned palette, it will be freed when the reference count
reaches 0, usually when the surface is destroyed\[char46]

Bitmap surfaces (with format

.BR SDL_PIXELFORMAT_INDEX1LSB
 or

.BR SDL_PIXELFORMAT_INDEX1MSB
) will have the
palette initialized with 0 as white and 1 as black\[char46] Other surfaces will get
a palette initialized with white in every entry\[char46]

If this function is called for a surface that already has a palette, a new
palette will be created to replace it\[char46]
