.TH SDL_TryLockRWLockForReading 3 "SDL 3.1.3" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_TryLockRWLockForReading \- Try to lock a read/write lock _for reading_ without blocking\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_mutex\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool SDL_TryLockRWLockForReading(SDL_RWLock *rwlock);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This works just like

.BR SDL_LockRWLockForReading
(), but if the rwlock
is not available, then this function returns false immediately\[char46]

This technique is useful if you need access to a resource but don't want to
wait for it, and will return to it to try again later\[char46]

Trying to lock for read-only access can succeed if other threads are
holding read-only locks, as this won't prevent access\[char46]

This function returns true if passed a NULL rwlock\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I rwlock
the rwlock to try to lock\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true on success, false if the lock would block\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
