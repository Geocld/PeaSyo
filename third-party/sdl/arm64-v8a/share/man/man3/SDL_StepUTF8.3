.SH NAME
SDL_StepUTF8 \- Decode a UTF-8 string, one Unicode codepoint at a time\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_stdinc\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "Uint32 SDL_StepUTF8(const char **pstr, size_t *pslen);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This will return the first Unicode codepoint in the UTF-8 encoded string in
.BR
.I pstr
, and then advance
.BR 
pstr
past any consumed bytes before returning\[char46]

It will not access more than
.BR
.I pslen
bytes from the string\[char46]
.BR 
pslen
will
be adjusted, as well, subtracting the number of bytes consumed\[char46]
.BR pslen
is allowed to be NULL, in which case the string _must_ be
NULL-terminated, as the function will blindly read until it sees the NULL
char\[char46]

if
.BR
.I pslen
is zero, it assumes the end of string is reached and returns a
zero codepoint regardless of the contents of the string buffer\[char46]

If the resulting codepoint is zero (a NULL terminator), or
.BR 
pslen
is
zero, it will not advance
.BR
.I pstr
or
.BR 
pslen
at all\[char46]

Generally this function is called in a loop until it returns zero,
adjusting its parameters each iteration\[char46]

If an invalid UTF-8 sequence is encountered, this function returns

.BR SDL_INVALID_UNICODE_CODEPOINT
 and advances
the string/length by one byte (which is to say, a multibyte sequence might
produce several

.BR SDL_INVALID_UNICODE_CODEPOINT
 returns
before it syncs to the next valid UTF-8 sequence)\[char46]

Several things can generate invalid UTF-8 sequences, including overlong
encodings, the use of UTF-16 surrogate values, and truncated data\[char46] Please
refer to

.URL "https://www\[char46]ietf\[char46]org/rfc/rfc3629\[char46]txt" "RFC3629"

for details\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I pstr
a pointer to a UTF-8 string pointer to be read and adjusted\[char46]
.TP
.I pslen
a pointer to the number of bytes in the string, to be read and adjusted\[char46] NULL is allowed\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the first Unicode codepoint in the string\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
