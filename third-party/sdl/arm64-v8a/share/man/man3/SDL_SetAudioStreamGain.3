.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool SDL_SetAudioStreamGain(SDL_AudioStream *stream, float gain);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The gain of a stream is its volume; a larger gain means a louder output,
with a gain of zero being silence\[char46]

Audio streams default to a gain of 1\[char46]0f (no change in output)\[char46]

This is applied during 
.BR SDL_GetAudioStreamData
,
and can be continuously changed to create various effects\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I stream
the stream on which the gain is being changed\[char46]
.TP
.I gain
the gain\[char46] 1\[char46]0f is no change, 0\[char46]0f is silence\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true on success or false on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread, as it holds a
stream-specific mutex while running\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
