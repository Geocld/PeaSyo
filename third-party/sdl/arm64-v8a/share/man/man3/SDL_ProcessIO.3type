.SH DESCRIPTION
If a standard I/O stream is set to

.BR SDL_PROCESS_STDIO_INHERIT
, it will go to the
same place as the application's I/O stream\[char46] This is the default for
standard output and standard error\[char46]

If a standard I/O stream is set to

.BR SDL_PROCESS_STDIO_NULL
, it is connected to
.BR NUL:
on Windows and
.BR /dev/null
on POSIX systems\[char46] This is the default for
standard input\[char46]

If a standard I/O stream is set to

.BR SDL_PROCESS_STDIO_APP
, it is connected to a new

.BR SDL_IOStream
 that is available to the application\[char46] Standard
input will be available as

.BR
.BR SDL_PROP_PROCESS_STDIN_POINTER
and
allows 
.BR SDL_GetProcessInput
(), standard output will
be available as

.BR
.BR SDL_PROP_PROCESS_STDOUT_POINTER
and
allows 
.BR SDL_ReadProcess
() and

.BR SDL_GetProcessOutput
(), and standard error will be
available as

.BR
.BR SDL_PROP_PROCESS_STDERR_POINTER
in the
properties for the created process\[char46]

If a standard I/O stream is set to

.BR SDL_PROCESS_STDIO_REDIRECT
, it is connected
to an existing 
.BR SDL_IOStream
 provided by the application\[char46]
Standard input is provided using

.BR
.BR SDL_PROP_PROCESS_CREATE_STDIN_POINTER
,
standard output is provided using

.BR
.BR SDL_PROP_PROCESS_CREATE_STDOUT_POINTER
,
and standard error is provided using

.BR
.BR SDL_PROP_PROCESS_CREATE_STDERR_POINTER
in the creation properties\[char46] These existing streams should be closed by the
application once the new process is created\[char46]

In order to use an 
.BR SDL_IOStream
 with

.BR SDL_PROCESS_STDIO_REDIRECT
, it must have

.BR
.BR SDL_PROP_IOSTREAM_WINDOWS_HANDLE_POINTER
or

.BR
.BR SDL_PROP_IOSTREAM_FILE_DESCRIPTOR_NUMBER
set\[char46] This is true for streams representing files and process I/O\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This enum is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
