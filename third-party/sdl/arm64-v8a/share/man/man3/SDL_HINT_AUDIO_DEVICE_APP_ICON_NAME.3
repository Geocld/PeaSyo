.SH DESCRIPTION
Some audio backends (such as Pulseaudio and Pipewire) allow you to set an
XDG icon name for your application\[char46] Among other things, this icon might
show up in a system control panel that lets the user adjust the volume on
specific audio streams instead of using one giant master volume slider\[char46]
Note that this is unrelated to the icon used by the windowing system, which
may be set with 
.BR SDL_SetWindowIcon
 (or via desktop file
on Wayland)\[char46]

Setting this to "" or leaving it unset will have SDL use a reasonable
default, "applications-games", which is likely to be installed\[char46] See
https://specifications\[char46]freedesktop\[char46]org/icon-theme-spec/icon-theme-spec-latest\[char46]html
and
https://specifications\[char46]freedesktop\[char46]org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest\[char46]html
for the relevant XDG icon specs\[char46]

This hint should be set before an audio device is opened\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This hint is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
