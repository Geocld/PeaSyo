.TH SDL_SetAudioStreamOutputChannelMap 3 "SDL 3.1.3" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_SetAudioStreamOutputChannelMap \- Set the current output channel map of an audio stream\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_audio\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool SDL_SetAudioStreamOutputChannelMap(SDL_AudioStream *stream, const int *chmap, int count);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Channel maps are optional; most things do not need them, instead passing
data in the [order that SDL expects](CategoryAudio#channel-layouts)\[char46]

The output channel map reorders data that leaving a stream via

.BR SDL_GetAudioStreamData
\[char46]

Each item in the array represents an output channel, and its value is the
channel that it should be remapped to\[char46] To reverse a stereo signal's left
and right values, you'd have an array of
.BR { 1, 0 }
\[char46] It is legal to remap
multiple channels to the same thing, so
.BR { 1, 1 }
would duplicate the
right channel to both channels of a stereo signal\[char46] You cannot change the
number of channels through a channel map, just reorder them\[char46]

The output channel map can be changed at any time, as output remapping is
applied during 
.BR SDL_GetAudioStreamData
\[char46]

Audio streams default to no remapping applied\[char46] Passing a NULL channel map
is legal, and turns off remapping\[char46]

SDL will copy the channel map; the caller does not have to save this array
after this call\[char46]

If
.BR count
is not equal to the current number of channels in the audio
stream's format, this will fail\[char46] This is a safety measure to make sure a a
race condition hasn't changed the format while you this call is setting the
channel map\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I stream
the 
.BR SDL_AudioStream
 to change\[char46]
.TP
.I chmap
the new channel map, NULL to reset to default\[char46]
.TP
.I count
The number of channels in the map\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true on success or false on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread, as it holds a
stream-specific mutex while running\[char46] Don't change the stream's format to
have a different number of channels from a a different thread at the same
time, though!

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
