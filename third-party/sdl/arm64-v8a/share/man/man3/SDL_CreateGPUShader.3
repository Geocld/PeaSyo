.SH NAME
SDL_CreateGPUShader \- Creates a shader to be used when creating a graphics pipeline\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_gpu\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq

.BI "    SDL_GPUDevice *device,

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Shader resource bindings must be authored to follow a particular order
depending on the shader format\[char46]

For SPIR-V shaders, use the following resource sets:

For vertex shaders:


\(bu 0: Sampled textures, followed by storage textures, followed by storage
  buffers

\(bu 1: Uniform buffers

For fragment shaders:


\(bu 2: Sampled textures, followed by storage textures, followed by storage
  buffers

\(bu 3: Uniform buffers

For DXBC Shader Model 5_0 shaders, use the following register order:


\(bu t registers: Sampled textures, followed by storage textures, followed by
  storage buffers

\(bu s registers: Samplers with indices corresponding to the sampled textures

\(bu b registers: Uniform buffers

For DXIL shaders, use the following register order:

For vertex shaders:


\(bu (t[n], space0): Sampled textures, followed by storage textures, followed
  by storage buffers

\(bu (s[n], space0): Samplers with indices corresponding to the sampled
  textures

\(bu (b[n], space1): Uniform buffers

For pixel shaders:


\(bu (t[n], space2): Sampled textures, followed by storage textures, followed
  by storage buffers

\(bu (s[n], space2): Samplers with indices corresponding to the sampled
  textures

\(bu (b[n], space3): Uniform buffers

For MSL/metallib, use the following order:


\(bu [[texture]]: Sampled textures, followed by storage textures

\(bu [[sampler]]: Samplers with indices corresponding to the sampled textures

\(bu [[buffer]]: Uniform buffers, followed by storage buffers\[char46] Vertex buffer 0
  is bound at [[buffer(14)]], vertex buffer 1 at [[buffer(15)]], and so on\[char46]
  Rather than manually authoring vertex buffer indices, use the
  [[stage_in]] attribute which will automatically use the vertex input
  information from the 
.BR SDL_GPUPipeline
\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I device
a GPU Context\[char46]
.TP
.I createinfo
a struct describing the state of the shader to create\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
(
.BR SDL_GPUShader
 *) Returns a shader object on success, or
NULL on failure; call 
.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
