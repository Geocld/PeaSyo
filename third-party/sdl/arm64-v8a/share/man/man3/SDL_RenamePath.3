.TH SDL_RenamePath 3 "SDL 3.1.3" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_RenamePath \- Rename a file or directory\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_filesystem\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool SDL_RenamePath(const char *oldpath, const char *newpath);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
If the file at
.BR newpath
already exists, it will replaced\[char46]

Note that this will not copy files across filesystems/drives/volumes, as
that is a much more complicated (and possibly time-consuming) operation\[char46]

Which is to say, if this function fails, 
.BR SDL_CopyFile
() to
a temporary file in the same directory as
.BR newpath
, then

.BR SDL_RenamePath
() from the temporary file to
.BR newpath
and

.BR SDL_RemovePath
() on
.BR oldpath
might work for files\[char46]
Renaming a non-empty directory across filesystems is dramatically more
complex, however\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I oldpath
the old path\[char46]
.TP
.I newpath
the new path\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true on success or false on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
