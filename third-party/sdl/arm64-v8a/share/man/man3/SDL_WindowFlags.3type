.SH DESCRIPTION
These cover a lot of true/false, or on/off, window state\[char46] Some of it is
immutable after being set through 
.BR SDL_CreateWindow
(),
some of it can be changed on existing windows by the app, and some of it
might be altered by the user or system outside of the app's control\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This datatype is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
