.TH SDL_realloc 3 "SDL 3.1.3" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_realloc \- Change the size of allocated memory\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_stdinc\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "void * SDL_realloc(void *mem, size_t size);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The memory returned by this function must be freed with

.BR SDL_free
()\[char46]

If
.BR size
is 0, it will be set to 1\[char46] Note that this is unlike some other C
runtime
.BR realloc
implementations, which may treat
.BR realloc(mem, 0)
the
same way as
.BR free(mem)
\[char46]

If
.BR mem
is NULL, the behavior of this function is equivalent to

.BR SDL_malloc
()\[char46] Otherwise, the function can have one of three
possible outcomes:


\(bu If it returns the same pointer as
.BR mem
, it means that
.BR mem
was resized
  in place without freeing\[char46]

\(bu If it returns a different non-NULL pointer, it means that
.BR mem
was freed
  and cannot be dereferenced anymore\[char46]

\(bu If it returns NULL (indicating failure), then
.BR mem
will remain valid and
  must still be freed with 
.BR SDL_free
()\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I mem
a pointer to allocated memory to reallocate, or NULL\[char46]
.TP
.I size
the new size of the memory\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns a pointer to the newly allocated memory, or NULL if
allocation failed\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
