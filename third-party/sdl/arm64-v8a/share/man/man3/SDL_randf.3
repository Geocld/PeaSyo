.SH DESCRIPTION
If you want reproducible output, be sure to initialize with

.BR SDL_srand
() first\[char46]

There are no guarantees as to the quality of the random sequence produced,
and this should not be used for security (cryptography, passwords) or where
money is on the line (loot-boxes, casinos)\[char46] There are many random number
libraries available with different characteristics and you should pick one
of those to meet any serious needs\[char46]

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns a random value in the range of [0\[char46]0, 1\[char46]0)\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
All calls should be made from a single thread

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
