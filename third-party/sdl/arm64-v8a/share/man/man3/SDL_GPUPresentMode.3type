.TH SDL_GPUPresentMode 3type "SDL 3.1.3" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 DATATYPES"
.SH NAME
SDL_GPUPresentMode \- Specifies the timing that will be used to present swapchain textures to the OS\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_gpu\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "typedef enum SDL_GPUPresentMode
.BI "{
.BI "    SDL_GPU_PRESENTMODE_VSYNC,
.BI "    SDL_GPU_PRESENTMODE_IMMEDIATE,
.BI "    SDL_GPU_PRESENTMODE_MAILBOX
.BI "} SDL_GPUPresentMode;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Note that this value affects the behavior of

.BR SDL_AcquireGPUSwapchainTexture
\[char46] VSYNC
mode will always be supported\[char46] IMMEDIATE and MAILBOX modes may not be
supported on certain systems\[char46]

It is recommended to query

.BR SDL_WindowSupportsGPUPresentMode
 after
claiming the window if you wish to change the present mode to IMMEDIATE or
MAILBOX\[char46]


\(bu VSYNC: Waits for vblank before presenting\[char46] No tearing is possible\[char46] If
  there is a pending image to present, the new image is enqueued for
  presentation\[char46] Disallows tearing at the cost of visual latency\[char46] When using
  this present mode, AcquireGPUSwapchainTexture will block if too many
  frames are in flight\[char46]

\(bu IMMEDIATE: Immediately presents\[char46] Lowest latency option, but tearing may
  occur\[char46] When using this mode, AcquireGPUSwapchainTexture will return NULL
  if too many frames are in flight\[char46]

\(bu MAILBOX: Waits for vblank before presenting\[char46] No tearing is possible\[char46] If
  there is a pending image to present, the pending image is replaced by the
  new image\[char46] Similar to VSYNC, but with reduced visual latency\[char46] When using
  this mode, AcquireGPUSwapchainTexture will return NULL if too many frames
  are in flight\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This enum is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0
