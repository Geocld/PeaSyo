.TH SDL_RunApp 3 "SDL 3.1.3" "Simple Directmedia Layer" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_RunApp \- Initializes and launches an SDL application, by doing platform-specific initialization before calling your mainFunction and cleanups after it returns, if that is needed for a specific platform, otherwise it just calls mainFunction\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3/SDL_main\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_RunApp(int argc, char *argv[], SDL_main_func mainFunction, void *reserved);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
You can use this if you want to use your own main() implementation without
using 
.BR SDL_main
 (like when using

.BR SDL_MAIN_HANDLED
)\[char46] When using this, you do
.I not
need

.BR SDL_SetMainReady
()\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I argc
the argc parameter from the application's main() function, or 0 if the platform's main-equivalent has no argc\[char46]
.TP
.I argv
the argv parameter from the application's main() function, or NULL if the platform's main-equivalent has no argv\[char46]
.TP
.I mainFunction
your SDL app's C-style main()\[char46] NOT the function you're calling this from! Its name doesn't matter; it doesn't literally have to be
.BR main
\[char46]
.TP
.I reserved
should be NULL (reserved for future use, will probably be platform-specific then)\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the return value from mainFunction: 0 on success, otherwise
failure; 
.BR SDL_GetError
() might have more information on the
failure\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
Generally this is called once, near startup, from the process's initial
thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
